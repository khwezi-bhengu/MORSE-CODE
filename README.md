WHAT IS MORSE CODE?
Who Invented Morse Code?
The Morse code is a way of representing numeric and alphabetic characters/symbols by using dots and dashes as signals. Morse code took its name from the American who invented the telegraph; Samuel Morse.
Their invention was needed to transmit texts by using pulses of electricity and the periods of inactivity between the pulses.

By 1837, Samuel Morse had finished work on his codes which became the basis of contemporary International Morse code. Two English inventors, William Cooke and Charles Wheatstone became the first to incorporate electromagnets to a telegraph receiver. In 1837, they obtained a patent from England and showcased their work on a railway in London. This became the first known commercial purpose telegraph. William and Charles improved their invention in 1841, by building the telegraph which could print letters by using a hammer to strike the wheeled surface of a typeface.

Usage of Morse Code in World War I & II
In the 1890s, Morse code began to find use in radio communications. The challenge was that transmitting voice signals through Morse code wasn’t feasible at that time. When the messages were sent through radio waves, the electronic dots and dashes were converted into short tones and long tones. Telegraph operators were trained to listen and interpret the tones. Radio operators called the tones, dits and dahs. As a coded means of communication, Morse code was heavily employed for communications, during World War 1 and 2. The Morse code system had a smaller communication bandwidth – it was suitable for high frequency (HF) radio waves. Skillful Morse code operators could still read a message even if the signal was distorted by noise.

Morse code is a method of encoding text characters using sequences of dots and dashes, allowing for efficient communication over long distances.
